The [NHS Accelerated Access Collaborative](https://www.england.nhs.uk/aac/about-us/) states that:

> “Our Ambition is to help make the UK one of the most pro-innovation health systems in the world”

To do this the AAC focusses on speeding up access to the best technologies and products - leading to better care for patients.   It also helps industry understanding of the need in the NHS and provides greater support to investors.   

[Christopher Kelly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502619/) reports in the future healthcare journal on the different innovation routes and funding within the NHS.   These initiatives focus on proven small scale work which are being encouraged to scale up and spread.   The question then arises within this environment where is the support for tackling the unknowns and the developing research.  Often this is left to academia to evolve and then for “the market” to make into actionable solutions.  This leads to some innovation becoming rather expensive to incorporate in the NHS or to a very slow timescale for bleeding edge research to reach NHS operations.  

## Where we fit

The Analytics Unit Innovation Branch has set out to support this innovation work by increasing the connection between NHS operations and academia through identifying unknowns that require a solution for current and future innovations to be actionable on patient data in the NHS. 

In healthcare innovation, there are many unknowns and issues to overcome.  Some general areas which require input include:

- **Access** - Due to data usage restrictions and privacy, it can become difficult to obtain access to data across multiple silos and systems
- **Bias** - Intrinsic data bias is common in all healthcare data
- **Engagement** - translating the data into understandable evidence which can support patients and the health service often requires some level of translation before it will have the potential impact.
- **Insight Extraction** - Having the algorithms to hand to understand what a complex large data set is showing
- **Interoperability** - different data collections use different standards and mandate different data items.  Often one service will use a different way of coding the same activity as another.
- **Knowledge transfer** - how to share successful data analysis across the system and make our tools reusable in other contexts.  
- **Linkage** - Joining datasets together requires common features and data indexing.  Even with universal data features (e.g. NHS number) this linkage can still be problematic and often additional fuzzy matching
- **Privacy** - Anonymization, redaction and obfuscation are not always enough to ensure the privacy of our data
- **Quality** - The size and duplication of the data collections can lead to missing data and incorrect data inputs.

In particular we focus on **Data Access**, **Knowledge Transfer** and **Privacy** through supporting:
- the sharing of text and unstructured data, 
- the generation and appropriate use of synthetic data,
- the understanding of privacy in our data,
- the extraction of insight using graph-based representations of data,
- the sharing and reuse of data tools and analysis.

Many of these issues required specialist knowledge and research that is already being investigated in academia.   We therefore 

## Our Work

Many of these areas have strong current research in academia.  However, connecting academic research to NHS operations and decision making often proves difficult due to timelines, expectations and application of the research to messy real-world data.   We aim to partially fill the gap between academia and the NHS.

Research to operations only works if there is both a push from research and a pull from operations. 

**Push** - Through our [Data Science Intern Scheme](https://nhsx.github.io/AnalyticsUnit/phdinterns.html) we demonstrate how current research could have value in an NHS context.  This scheme is aimed at PhD students who are currently working on areas related to the areas set out above.  Through these five month internships we can tap into the bleeding edge whilst providing NHS industry placements connecting our needs and interests to current research.  Beyond the initial projects we hope that over time we can develop relationships with individuals, institutes and groups to support the wider collaboration of NHS and academia. 

**Pull** - By aiming at open tangible piecemeal prototypes with ingrained thinking around application to NHS data structures and interests we aim to bring fully formed specifications to key stakeholders to support commissioning and development of solutions.  We believe that working transparently where possible is the best way for our work to have impact as well as the best way to start open frank discussions about the unknowns not being addressed and the unspoken need for NHS Innovation.  We aim to have all of our projects to include some form of public facing component ranging from a simple notification of the work to published code or data.
