Digital transformation is the core focus for NHSX - what does that mean for innovation analytics

For the innovation branch in the NHSX Analytics unit, we have asked what would success look like for us in five years time:
- **Enabling others through data access:**
Text data to be as common a data source for analysis as structured EHR
All NHS analysts to be able to access necessary data through platform or synthetic

- **Enabling others through culture:**
Use of open ways of coding and sharing of code commonplace across national and local analysts
Analysis and tools created with view on interoperability to enable reuse across different use-cases 

- **Enabling others through example:**
Showcasing innovative techniques in areas of active interest
Demonstrating use of frameworks and tools for sharing work

- **Enabling others through guidance:**
Identifying appropriate technology choices to enable modern analytical approaches to be used
Openly discuss approaches (both benefits and limitations)
