<h1>Welcome</h1>

**This site is currently under trial and review**

The NHS Engalnd Transformation Directorate Analytics Unit *(formally NHSX Analytics Unit)* sees open ways of working as pivotal to increasing innovation and efficiency in the NHS.  This site has been created so we can share some focussed technical thoughts and examples.  

Within the unit we have analysts, data engineers, data scientists, developers, economists, and evaluation specialists.   Here we will advertise public projects from all these disciplines as well as publishing thoughts on how healthcare analysts can interact with the open tools and data.
