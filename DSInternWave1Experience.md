My name is Tiyi and I’m a PhD student in Health Economics at NIHR North Thames ARC at  UCL. This summer I worked on a simulation model project as part of my internship at NHSX. Here are a quick couple of thoughts and tips for others applying to the scheme.

I gained a lot from the internship. It was a fantastic opportunity to take a project idea and really run with it, with lots of support. I met lots of key people working in NHSX Innovation and Digital Transformation and the NHS England Diabetes team. I learned about key priorities and policy goals for the NHS now, which will be helpful for my PhD. I had a lot of freedom to say what the important components to include in the model were from my perspective, and to collaborate with a team inside and outside of the NHS. I also worked with the teams at Faculty and Hash (specialists in Data Science outside the NHS) to develop the methods used in the project and the plan for building the intelligence layer in the future. 

The project was initially about [longitudinal synthetic data](https://github.com/nhsx/nhsx-internship-projects/blob/gh-pages/projects/synthetic-data-exploration-longitudinal.md), and I combined this theme with the case of digital health for type 2 diabetes that I’m looking at in my PhD project. I was really excited by the potential for using synthetic data in large simulations and the policy relevance of looking at this case. It’s important to say that there’s lots of flexibility in the projects. If you have a great idea that links to the themes of the project, don’t be afraid to put your own spin on it.

Finally, you should make sure that you think about the way your PhD work and experience have shown you have transferable skills. Sometimes in quantitative disciplines we use different words to explain similar techniques in another field. Make sure you can communicate that the skills you have would make you a great intern.

Good luck with your application!

My name is Dom and I’m a PhD student affiliated with The Alan Turing Institute and the University of Birmingham focussing on the development of machine learning (ML) methodology with applications to a variety of health data settings. In the summer of 2021 I was fortunate to undertake a PhD Data Science Internship within the Innovation Branch of the NHSX Analytics Unit (NHSXAU). My project was aimed at applying the Variational Autoencoder to the problem of synthetic data generation in the context of the NHS.

Given the nature of potential NHS use cases, it was important for the project to consider both the fidelity of the synthetic data and the extent to which the privacy of individuals’ data was retained. Prior to the project I had worked extensively with Variational Autoencoders, however had not been directly involved with synthetic data generation or formal privacy-preserving ML approaches. I therefore saw the project as an excellent opportunity to work on a project which both utilised knowledge I had developed during my PhD whilst simultaneously introducing me to additional areas of the field. It also represented the opportunity to see how approaches and priorities may differ between the academic world which I was accustomed to and that of a research-aware public sector setting like the NHSXAU.

I highly recommend the scheme and strongly encourage you to apply if the internship scheme’s projects and format appeal to you. Within your application be sure to mention explicit experiences you may have had working with data and the tools you used. Also communicate why you have chosen the particular project(s) you have applied for. It may be that it is particularly related (or unrelated!) to your normal work - whatever it is, be sure to make it clear. Finally, do make use of the interview to ask questions about the project and put forward the ways in which you think you may develop it. This will show that you have thought through the process thoroughly and will more than likely lead to a fun and free-flowing discussion between you and the panel.

Best of luck with your application!
