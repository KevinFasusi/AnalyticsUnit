My name is Tiyi and I’m a PhD student in Health Economics at NIHR North Thames ARC at  UCL. This summer I worked on a simulation model project as part of my internship at NHSX. Here are a quick couple of thoughts and tips for others applying to the scheme.

I gained a lot from the internship. It was a fantastic opportunity to take a project idea and really run with it, with lots of support. I met lots of key people working in NHSX Innovation and Digital Transformation and the NHS England Diabetes team. I learned about key priorities and policy goals for the NHS now, which will be helpful for my PhD. I had a lot of freedom to say what the important components to include in the model were from my perspective, and to collaborate with a team inside and outside of the NHS. I also worked with the teams at Faculty and Hash (specialists in Data Science outside the NHS) to develop the methods used in the project and the plan for building the intelligence layer in the future. 

The project was initially about [longitudinal synthetic data](https://github.com/nhsx/nhsx-internship-projects/blob/gh-pages/projects/synthetic-data-exploration-longitudinal.md), and I combined this theme with the case of digital health for type 2 diabetes that I’m looking at in my PhD project. I was really excited by the potential for using synthetic data in large simulations and the policy relevance of looking at this case. It’s important to say that there’s lots of flexibility in the projects. If you have a great idea that links to the themes of the project, don’t be afraid to put your own spin on it.

Finally, you should make sure that you think about the way your PhD work and experience have shown you have transferable skills. Sometimes in quantitative disciplines we use different words to explain similar techniques in another field. Make sure you can communicate that the skills you have would make you a great intern.

Good luck with your application!
